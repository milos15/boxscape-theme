                <small class="text-faded"> Written by Miloš Babić </small>
                <p class="mt-2 custom-article">
                If you consider yourself a serious business person who wants to start an online business, then you need to know something about the internet strategies. How to make a website? How to approach your potential customers? How to stimulate them to buy your product? 
                <br> <br>
                The most important thing here is the visualization of your products and services. Speaking about visualization, the first step in this process would be creating a website which would properly present your wide range of products and services through interesting colors and well-designed packages. A simple and creative categorization of your products will certainly help you to find your potential customers faster. 
                <br> <br>
                Since the most population on the Earth are using mobile phones, you should consider creating a website which will be mobile friendly. That simply means that people will see every little detail (pictures, specifications, reviews) about your products and services when they visit your website on their mobile phone. Most of the programmers today create the mobile responsive websites first and then they start to work on versions which will be visible on tablets and computers. 
                <br> <br>
                If you have a website which is not mobile responsive, you need to immediately start to work on this. The best way would be hiring a digital agency which will make this transformation for you. Most of these companies are specialized in SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) which means that your website after this transformation will be more visible in Google search and in the same time more approachable to your customers.

                <h4 class="text-center mt-5" id="article-2"> How to Respond to Negative Feedback </h4>
                <small class="text-faded"> Written by Miloš Babić </small>
                <p class="mt-2 custom-article"> Negative customer reviews are the signal that something is wrong with your products or services. The worst thing, in this case, would be ignoring these reviews. Because an unsatisfied customer is trying to say to you that something is not good with your product and wants help from you. 
                <br> <br>
                Every responsible company needs to provide the answers to these requests and try to solve these problems as soon as possible. On the other hand, there will always be situations where certain companies will face some irrational feedback from their customers. Whether it is rational or irrational feedback, this can ruin your internet reputation. So, every company needs to implement an online reputation management strategy in order to keep their brand alive and to keep a good image on the market. 
                <br> <br>
                What is the main goal of these strategies? Since you are facing some negative critics from your customers, you need to have more positive reviews which will make these negative comments less important according to the others. That doesn't mean that you need to ignore people who complain about your products or services. On the contrary, you should take these negative critics into consideration and correct the mistakes that you made.
                <br> <br>
                Today, keeping a good internet reputation is the key factor, when we are talking about online businesses. Because, when people decide to buy your product, the first thing they do is to check out the reviews about your company on the internet. If you are a company who has a lot of negative feedback or doesn't even provide the chance of leaving feedback on your website, that can be a signal for potential customers that something is wrong. So, choosing a proper digital marketing company which is specialized in this area would be a great choice for you because you will save a lot of time and money.
